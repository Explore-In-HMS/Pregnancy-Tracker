## What You Will Need


### Hardware Requirements
-	A computer that can run Android Studio.
-	A Huawei phone for debugging.
### Software Requirements
-	Android SDK package
-	Android Studio 3.X-4.X
-	HMS Core (APK) 4.X or later

## Getting Started

Pregnancy Tracker app uses HUAWEI services. In order to use them, you have to [create an app](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-create_app) first. Before getting started, please [sign-up](https://id1.cloud.huawei.com/CAS/portal/userRegister/regbyemail.html?service=https%3A%2F%2Foauth-login1.cloud.huawei.com%2Foauth2%2Fv2%2Flogin%3Faccess_type%3Doffline%26client_id%3D6099200%26display%3Dpage%26flowID%3D6d751ab7-28c0-403c-a7a8-6fc07681a45d%26h%3D1603370512.3540%26lang%3Den-us%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdeveloper.huawei.com%252Fconsumer%252Fen%252Flogin%252Fhtml%252FhandleLogin.html%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Dopenid%2Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.huawei.com%252Fauth%252Faccount%252Fcountry%2Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.huawei.com%252Fauth%252Faccount%252Fbase.profile%26v%3D9f7b3af3ae56ae58c5cb23a5c1ff5af7d91720cea9a897be58cff23593e8c1ed&loginUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fid1.cloud.huawei.com%3A443%2FCAS%2Fportal%2FloginAuth.html&clientID=6099200&lang=en-us&display=page&loginChannel=89000060&reqClientType=89) for a HUAWEI developer account.

After creating the application, you need to [generate a signing certificate fingerprint](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/index.html#3). Then you have to set this fingerprint to the application you created in AppGallery Connect.
- Go to "My Projects" in AppGallery Connect.
- Find your project from the project list and click the app on the project card.
- On the Project Setting page, set SHA-256 certificate fingerprint to the SHA-256 fingerprint you've generated.

![AGC-Fingerprint](https://communityfile-drcn.op.hicloud.com/FileServer/getFile/cmtyPub/011/111/111/0000000000011111111.20200511174103.08977471998788006824067329965155:50510612082412:2800:6930AD86F3F5AF6B2740EF666A56165E65A37E64FA305A30C5EFB998DA38D409.png?needInitFileName=true?needInitFileName=true?needInitFileName=true?needInitFileName=true)

## Using the application

Before you run the app, make sure that you have a working internet connection since the application uses Huawei Mobile Services. Otherwise, the app will not be able to perform the security checks only after which you can use the app.

A login screen will welcome you at the first opening of the application. When you log in with Huawei ID, the date selection screen will appear. According to your selection, We calculate how many weeks and months your baby is. When you allow us to take your location, we show you the nearest hospital and pharmacies on a map. You can call directly from the application using its number of pharmacies and hospitals or you can start direction from your own location on the Petal Map.You can add diary for your baby in the application. Add to this diary what mode you are in You can do it. You can upload and edit photos. You can see your child's ultrasound for a certain fee in 3D space. You can send your location directly to that number as a message. You can receive notifications if you want to join notification channels. You can add contact number for emergency situations and send your location.
